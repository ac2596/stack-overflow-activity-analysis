# Contribution and Activity on Stack Overflow

Our main question and goal for this project and exploratory study is how do user demographics affect contribution and participation on Stack Overflow?
We will use the annual developer survey from Stack Overflow, which is the largest and most comprehensive survey of software developers and it is made available under the Open Database License.
There are six sections in this survey, which are: 
1. Basic Information
2. Education, Work, and Career
3. Technology and Tech Culture
4. Stack Overflow Usage + Community
5. Demographic Information
6. Final Qs
  
Most questions are optional and the results are anonymized to protect personal information of participants. With nearly 80,000 responses from over 180 countries and territories, this survey collects all-round information of the participants from identity to education background, and their developer experience from programming skills to participation in open source communities.
