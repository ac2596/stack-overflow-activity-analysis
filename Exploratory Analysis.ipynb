    "**Question:** How do user demographics impact contribution and participation on Stack Overflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:**\n",
    "Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)\n",
    "We will use the annual developer survey from Stack Overflow, which is the largest and most comprehensive survey of software developers and it is made available under the Open Database License.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details on Survey (overview of the survey topics):**\n",
    "There are six sections in this survey, which are: 1. Basic Information; 2. Education, Work, and Career; 3. Technology and Tech Culture; 4. Stack Overflow Usage + Community; 5. Demographic Information; 6. Final Qs. Most questions are optional and the results are anonymized to protect personal information of participants. With nearly 80,000 responses from over 180 countries and territories, this survey collects all-round information of the participants from identity to education background, and their developer experience from programming skills to participation in open source communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions that we will explore include: Which demographic groups (age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, and mental health) have the highest proportion of engagement? The lowest? Which groups are (proportionally) most likely and least likely to be contributors and not just users of the platform? We will also investigate intersectional behavior and trends, such as how non-straight people of color interact with the platform, and how that might differ from heterosexual individuals of color or non-straight and white individuals. Lastly, we will look at how the demographics of Stack Overflow users compare to demographics of other similar spaces (i.e. Quora)."
